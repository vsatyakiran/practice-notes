## What Is Project Management?

Project management is the planning and organization of a company's resources to move a specific task, event, or duty toward completion. It can involve a one-time project or an ongoing activity, and resources managed include personnel, finances, technology, and intellectual property.

### Types of Project Management

**Waterfall Project Management:** This is similar to traditional project management but includes the caveat that each task needs to be completed before the next one starts. Steps are linear and progress flows in one directionâ€”like a waterfall. Because of this, attention to task sequences and timelines is very important in this type of project management. Often, the size of the team working on the project will grow as smaller tasks are completed and larger tasks begin.

**Agile Project Management:** This is a more flexible approach to project management. Agile project management breaks tasks into smaller pieces and tests them as work progresses. Phases of the project are completed in parallel to each other by various team members in an organization. It is marked by the following characteristics:

- **Iterative:** Projects are divided into small parts or iterations, and each iteration is completed before moving on to the next one.x`
- **Incremental:** Each iteration builds on the previous one, adding new features and functionality.
- **Collaborative:** Team members work together to achieve project goals, share knowledge, and solve problems.
- **Adaptive:** The project adapts to changes in requirements, technology, or the business environment.
